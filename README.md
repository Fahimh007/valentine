# Valentine Project

This is a fun and interactive Valentine-themed web application built with React and Vite. The app features animations, music, and a playful "Yes/No" interaction.

## Features
- **Interactive Buttons**: Choose "Yes" or "No" to see different reactions.
- **Background Music**: Plays a romantic tune by default and switches to a celebration song when "Yes" is clicked.
- **Floating Hearts Animation**: Adds a charming visual effect.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
